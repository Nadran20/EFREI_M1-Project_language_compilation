## Downward analyzer

1) Write an algorithm to compute First and Next for each non-terminal
of a given grammar. Program this algorithm.
Choose the representation of a grammar in a text file. Your
program should read it, then display the First and Next for each non-terminal.
The program must allow the user to test several grammars without
being restarted.

2) Calculate and display the top-down table from the First
and Next functions.

3) Allow the user to explain the behavior of the parser on sentences
of his choice.

### List of renderings:
1. Detailed descriptions of the algorithms

2. The commented program

3. The test set (text files with grammars) and the execution traces.
Minimum to validate (score out of 15) : Part 1 (calculation of First and Next with display)
in working order.

If 1) and 2) are done the score can go up to 20

Part 3 : gives a bonus.
